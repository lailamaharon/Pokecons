# Pokecons
## Free and open source icons 

This project has for goal to create free and opensource pokemon icons for developpers and game makers.

We will be making all pokemons currently available and those which are going to be available available.

## Inspiration

Many Developpers are using copyrighted material which could cause them problems with Nintendo inc.* so I've decided that making available icons could give those developpers more freedom to make their software.

######*And other corporations which own copyright over pokemon material
