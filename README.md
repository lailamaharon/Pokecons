# Pokecons
## Free and open source icons 

This project has for goal to create free and opensource Pokemon™ icons for developpers and game makers.

We will be making all pokemons currently available and those which are going to be available available.

## Inspiration

Many Developpers are using copyrighted material which could cause them problems with Nintendo™ inc.* so I've decided that making available icons could give those developpers more freedom to make their software.

######*And other corporations which own copyright/trademarks over Pokemon™ material
